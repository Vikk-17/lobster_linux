1.Locate the name of your drive

  ```
  $ lsblk
  ```
  +- In the output of that command, you should see entries.
  +- Get the disk name for eg: sda or sdb or nvme0n1p5 or whatever.

2. Create a mount point

  +- The mount point will be the directory on your primary drive
  that will serve as a location you will access the secondary
  drive from
  +- This does not copy or move the files from one to other but,
  rather creates a place for the operating system to "mount" the
  secondary drive. Let's create a mount point called lets say 
  $ mkdir /media/data  -> or whatever place you want.
  +- Now open /etc/fstab with editor and at the bottom of that
  file write the following:

  <drive> <mount_point> <file_system> <defults> <dump> <fsck>

  /dev/sdb /media/data ntfs defaults 0 0 
  
  
  +- /dev/sdb -> the drive you want to mount
  +- /media/data -> the mount point
  +- ntfs -> file system
  +- defaults -> uses the defaults options
  +- 0 0 -> these fields are for dump and fsck. Just leave
  them both as zeros.
  

  +- Save the file and close.

3. Testing the mount

  +- All you need to do to test the mount is issue the command.
  $ mount -a
  +- If you receive no feedback, everything is good. You can now
  reboot your machine and the secondary drive will be automatically
  mounted so you can access the files from /media/data.
