VMWARE Workstation Installation
-------------------------------
# Problem: "Cannot open /dev/vmmon: No such file or directory" error when powering on a VM 

$ chmod a+x <file>.bundle
$ sudo ./<file>.bundle

$ sudo vmware-modconfig --console --install-all
+- You will see that there are issues with monitor and net, that's ok.

+- Generate a key
+- Run OpenSSL:
$ openssl req -new -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout VMWARE15.priv -outform DER -out VMWARE15.der -nodes -days 36500 -subj "/CN=VMWARE/"
+- You will see info that it did ok.


+- Use this key we just generated to sign the two kernel modules.
$ sudo /usr/src/linux-headers-$(uname -r)/scripts/sign-file sha256 ./VMWARE15.priv ./VMWARE15.der $(modinfo -n vmmon)
$ sudo /usr/src/linux-headers-$(uname -r)/scripts/sign-file sha256 ./VMWARE15.priv ./VMWARE15.der $(modinfo -n vmnet)
+- This does not give any feedback


+- Check that signature are applied correctly
$ tail $(modinfo -n vmmon) | grep "Module signature appended"
+- You should get Binary file (standard input) matches


+- Now we make this key trusted by importing it to machine owener key(MOK)
management system with command below.
$ sudo mokutil --import VMWARE15.der
+- This will ask you for a password, enter some new password a bit long
like vmware2001. Reenter the password.


+- Reboot. When reboot you should be presented with a menu with the blue
screen background, you have to make a way to enroll the key and enter
the password you just created, this happens only once, then continue to
boot.


+- To test the dirver/ moudle installed correctly enter the command
$ mokutil --test-key VMWARE15.der
+- You should get VMWARE15.der is already enrolled and that means VMWare
should be working.
